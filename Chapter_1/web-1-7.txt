1.7 meta Element
meta elements within the head container. The meta elements provide information about the web page.
The meta element is a void element (not a container), so it does not have an end tag. Note
how there are no end tags for the three meta elements in Figure 1.6. Many web programmers end their void elements with a space and a slash. For example:
<meta charset="utf-8" />
