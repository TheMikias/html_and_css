   1-6 title Element
The title property sets or returns the value of an element's title attribute.
The head element contains two types of elements—meta and title. In your web pages, you
should position them in the order shown in Figure 1.6, meta and then title. But in the interest of clarity, 
we’ll discuss the title element first.
